## Surviving a Legacy Codebase

This is the source for my
[PyConZA 2017 talk](https://2017.za.pycon.org/talks/43/) of the same name.

The video of the talk is available on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/H6HCRpUtawo)
and
[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/pyconza2017-Surviving_a_Legacy_Codebase).

The generated slides can be found at

probably rather less useful out of context.

The code examples in `code/` are taken from existing open source codebases that
I have maintained over the years, all with BSD or MIT licenses.

[reveal.js][1] (which is almost everything in `reveal.js/`) is covered by its
own MIT license (`reveal.js/LICENSE`) as are the minor modifications I made to
it for this presentation.

The [tomorrow-night syntax highlighting theme][2]
(`reveal.js/css/highlight_tomorrow.css`) doesn't have a listed license, but
[the theme upon which it is based][3] is covered by the MIT license.
